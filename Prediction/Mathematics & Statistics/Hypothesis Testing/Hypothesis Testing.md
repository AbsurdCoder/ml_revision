A way to test a specific fact or statement. 

Example 
You have a suspicion that your dog's favorite squeaky toy is just as entertaining to them as any other object they can chew on.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Your dog's level of excitement is the same for their favorite squeaky toy and any other chewable object.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Your dog's level of excitement is higher for their favorite squeaky toy than for any other chewable object. 


P-value : A statistical value that will tell us the probability of null hypothesis. Higher the p-value, higher the confidence we have on p-value. 
To reject null hypothesis we usually have p <= 0.05, i.e., favouring alternative hypothesis
